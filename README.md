### Overview and Origin
Founded in October 2014, Ant Financial is the largest FinTech company in the world right now. Formerly known as the Alipay, as they have gathered more consumer data and grew as a company, they started to branch out and offer more financial services- rebranding themselves as the Ant Financial. Alipay was founded by Jack Ma back in 2004 with the help of the Alibaba Group before transforming into Ant Financial in 2014. In 2015, Ant Financial raised [$4.5 billion in a funding round](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/04/26/5-things-to-know-about-chinas-ant-financial/) with investors. By the end of that year, the company was valued at about $60 billion.
