### Overview and Origin
Founded in October 2014, Ant Financial is the largest FinTech company in the world right now. Formerly known as the Alipay, as they have gathered more consumer data and grew as a company, they started to branch out and offer more financial services- rebranding themselves as the Ant Financial. Alipay was founded by Jack Ma back in 2004 with the help of the Alibaba Group before transforming into Ant Financial in 2014. In 2015, Ant Financial raised [$4.5 billion in a funding round](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/04/26/5-things-to-know-about-chinas-ant-financial/) with investors. By the end of that year, the company was valued at about $60 billion. However, this year they are [valued at about $200 billion.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-financial-valuation-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-ant-aims-for-200-billion-price-tag-in-private-share-sales-sources-idUSKBN1ZG1C6)


### Business Activities
Alipay has made it easy for buyers and sellers to make transactions online with a small fee. Their service is very similar to PayPal except that they do not charge any foreign exchange fee. According to [ChinaSalesCo](https://www.chinasalesco.com/services/exporter-tips/110-how-does-alipay-compare-with-paypal):
>“Another key difference is Paypal assists the wire of funds between users'-bank accounts, but Alipay qualifies and then moves funds between buyer-and-merchant-Alipay accounts.”

Along with these, as Alipay offers mobile wallet and touch pay, they have eliminated the need for cash for almost all the everyday transactions. In order to build such services and store data, they mainly used applications such as jQuery, PHP, React, JAVA, nginx, AngularJS, Lodash, Moment.js, Ant Design, Zepto.
