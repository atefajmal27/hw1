![](Ant_Financial_logo.png)

### Overview and Origin
Founded in October 2014, Ant Financial is the largest FinTech company in the world right now. Formerly known as the Alipay, as they have gathered more consumer data and grew as a company, they started to branch out and offer more financial services- rebranding themselves as the Ant Financial. Alipay was founded by Jack Ma back in 2004 with the help of the Alibaba Group before transforming into Ant Financial in 2014. In 2015, Ant Financial raised [$4.5 billion in a funding round](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/04/26/5-things-to-know-about-chinas-ant-financial/) with investors. By the end of that year, the company was valued at about $60 billion. However, this year they are [valued at about $200 billion.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-financial-valuation-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-ant-aims-for-200-billion-price-tag-in-private-share-sales-sources-idUSKBN1ZG1C6)


### Business Activities
Alipay has made it easy for buyers and sellers to make transactions online with a small fee. Their service is very similar to PayPal except that they do not charge any foreign exchange fee. According to [ChinaSalesCo](https://www.chinasalesco.com/services/exporter-tips/110-how-does-alipay-compare-with-paypal):
>Another key difference is Paypal assists the wire of funds between users'-bank accounts, but Alipay qualifies and then moves funds between buyer-and-merchant-Alipay accounts.

Along with these, as Alipay offers mobile wallet and touch pay, they have eliminated the need for cash for almost all the everyday transactions. In order to build such services and store data, they mainly used [applications](https://stackshare.io/alipay/alipay) such as jQuery, PHP, React, JAVA, nginx, AngularJS, Lodash, Moment.js, Ant Design, Zepto.

As Alipay expanded into Ant Financial, they have been able to offer more services than ever such as insurance, credit, loans, credit scoring, and wealth management. But their biggest financial service beside the Alipay has to be Yue Bao. Yue Bao means “leftover treasure”. This service made investing in a [money market fund](https://qz.com/1791778/ant-financials-yue-bao-is-no-longer-the-worlds-biggest-money-market-fund/) easy for consumers. 
>Yu’e Bao shocked banking executives around the world with its immense growth. It started when the widely used payment service Alipay (operated by Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba at the time) added the money market fund to its app. The fund was designed for spare cash, and Chinese consumers began using it like a checking account. They are able to pay for anything, from haircuts to hot pot dinners, directly out of their high-yielding investment holdings, seamlessly and easily. 

The fact that they acquired so much data over the years, it made it so much easier for them to dominate any financial service as they can very successfully predict consumer’s behavior. The company currently has [over 1.2 billion users around the world](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/ant-financial-no-ipo-timetable-but-plans-to-acquire-more-users-outside-china.html).The reason for them to be so huge is that they compete in various sectors of financial sectors as mentioned before. Here is a [graph](https://textile-future.com/archives/13257) that shows how dominant they are in different sectors:

Their ecosystem made it easy for their users to access different types of financial needs and just like Apple, once you’re in the ecosystem, you rarely leave because it is so convenient. And recently, they are partnering up with [companies from other countries](https://qz.com/1570052/ant-financials-alipay-is-expanding-rapidly-outside-of-china/) to expand their market as 
>Alipay is available in 54 markets, and is a partner with the likes of India’s Paytm (Ant also has
a stake in the fast growing payment service). Observers have long seen Alipay’s Chinese tourist strategy as a “spearhead” to one day go after non-Chinese customers.
